# Wine Club Welcome Page

A sample wine club signup page using Deno's Fresh, Typescript, Tailwind and Deno Deploy.

The purpose of this sample site is to show how lightweight and performant form pages can be by utilizing a combination of built-in HTML input validations and mostly-inline styling (by way of TailwindCSS).

### Usage

The project has been deployed to production. It can be found at: https://wine-club-welcome.deno.dev.

Otherwise, if you'd like to run it locally, make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
